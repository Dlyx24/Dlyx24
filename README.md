- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dlyx24 (Hugo Alexandre)
I have been working for a couple of year, started in 2018.

I have been doing frontend development for a couple of years now, mainly using react written in Typescript. 
I also touched on backend using Node, MySQL, Github Actions, Nginx and docker for small personal projects mainly for learning purpose.

There is no magic and because of this I like to know how things work inside the box.

Lately I have been focusing more on more frontend topis, like accessability, UX, performance, testing and best practices.
