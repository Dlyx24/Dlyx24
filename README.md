- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dlyx24 (Hugo Alexandre)

I started working in 2018 after I finished my Bsc in Computer Science.

I have been doing frontend development for a few years now using React and Typescript. 

Lately my interest has been more on open source projects and learning from the community. 
As of a goal for 2023, I want to contribute to some open source project that suits my interests.
