- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dlyx24 (Hugo Alexandre)

I started working in 2018 after I finished my Bsc in Computer Science.

I have been doing frontend development for a few years now, mainly using React written in Typescript and GraphQL to query the backend. 
I also touched on backend using Node, MySQL, GitHub Actions, Nginx and docker for small personal projects mainly for learning purpose.

There is no magic, and because of this I like to know how things work inside the box.

Lately I have been focusing more on frontend topics like, accessibility, UX, performance, testing and best practices.
